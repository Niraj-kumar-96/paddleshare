- 3D Interactive Landing Page: Implement a 3D hero scene with a floating car model or road animation that responds to parallax scrolling for an immersive experience.

- Ride Search & Booking (Passengers): Enable passengers to search and book rides based on their desired route and timing. Update ride booking status in real-time via the backend.
- Animated Route Visualization: Display a 3D route visualization on a map using Mapbox or Leaflet, providing users with a clear understanding of the journey.

- Real-time Eco Counter: Show the environmental impact via live updates of CO2 saved thanks to shared rides.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Royal Blue (#4169E1) for a clean and premium feel.
- Background color: Desaturated light blue (#E6EAF7) to complement the primary color without overwhelming the design.
- Accent color: A vibrant blue-violet (#8A2BE2) is chosen to provide good contrast and draw attention to CTAs and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font to convey a tech and futuristic feel, perfect for headers and CTAs. If longer text is anticipated, use this for headlines and 'Inter' for body.
- Body font: 'Inter' a grotesque-style sans-serif, will support 'Space Grotesk' by being a neutral font suitable for reading. Use this for longer sections of the site such as paragraphs or fine-print details.
- Incorporate 3D travel icons for key features, like floating icons on the About page and in the "How it Works" section.
- Use glassmorphism cards with rounded corners and soft drop shadows to create depth and a modern aesthetic.
- Employ smooth Framer Motion animations for parallax scrolling, hover tilts, and loading transitions to enhance the interactive feel.
